#Humming

A Processing sketch for exploring the images uploaded to Flickr at the locations of all known US Military drone strikes, as documented by [Dronestre.am](http://dronestre.am/).

The basis of the project stems from the [Living Under Drones Report](http://www.livingunderdrones.org/living-under-drones/) of 2012, written by the International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic of Stanford Law School  and the Global Justice Clinic of the NYU School of Law.

One aspect of the report is the mental health issues caused by the sounds of drones regularly flying over head. 

*Anxiety, fear, panic. The drones are always humming.*
